### Hi there! I'm Timi Olayinka 👋

I am an **Analytics Engineer** focused on building reliable, high-quality data pipelines.

I combine advanced **SQL** and **Python** skills with the strategic frameworks of the **Applied Data Governance Practitioner (ADGP)** certification (currently pursuing).

**My Value Proposition:**
I don't just write queries; I engineer trusted data assets. I bridge the gap between messy raw data and actionable business insights, ensuring every pipeline is documented, tested, and governed.
